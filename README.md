Job Salary and Job Role Prediction
----------------------------------

When on the hunt for a data science job, your platform of choice could include at least one of the following:
- Seek
- LinkedIn
- Your own professional network
- Family & friends referrals

Out of these four options, it would be easy to consider Seek as your default choice and the main reason for that is their sheer volume of job postings that is almost unmatched by any of the other alternatives.

This however comes at a significant cost on the part of the job seeker, as having to sift through a vast array of job postings can easily become overwhelming.

The Job Salary & Job Role Prediction system is designed to address this problem, specifically through the following main objectives:

Objective 1: Salary Prediction: to predict whether a given data role is a low-salary role or a high-salary role.

Objective 2: Job Role Prediction: to predict whether a job posting is a data scientist, data engineer, or a data analyst role. 

The following are supporting objectives that enhance the system's functionality and complement the abovementioned main objectives:

Objective 3: Adjusted-Threshold Prediction: to tweak the salary predictions to minimize false positives.

Objective 4: Feature Identification: to identify the important features within a job posting that help identify the type of data role. 

The dataset was obtained by scraping 13300 job postings from the Seek (seek.com.au) website. These are 'data' jobs located in major cities in Australia.

Models evaluated for prediction include the following:
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- KNN
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Extra Trees
- Bagging
- Support Vector Machines
- Stochastic Gradient Descent
